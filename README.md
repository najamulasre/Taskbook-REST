# Taskbook-REST
Taskbook is a software project to implement **RESTfull** architecture. The project was carried out as fulfilment of the requirements for the complention of **BSc (Hons) degree in Computer Science** at the **University of West London**, London, United Kingdom. The project is actullay a demonstration of leaning through the reasearch project aimed at exploring, understanding and implementing Representation State Transfer (REST) architecture in depth with a critical view of why REST, what lead to REST, what is addressed by REST, what is REST and how to implemnt REST.
